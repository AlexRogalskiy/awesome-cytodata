# Awesome Cytodata [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome cytodata resources.

![cytodata logo](cytodata-logo.png)

[Cytodata](https://cytodata.org/) refers to a community of researchers and resources involved in the **image-based profiling** of **biological phenotypes**.
These **biological phenotypes** are typically induced by genetic or chemical perturbations and often represent disease states.
**Image-based profiling** is used to inspect these phenotypes to uncover biological insight including discovering the impact of genetic alterations and determining the mechanism of action of compounds.

This page represents a curated list of software, datasets, landmark publications, and image-based profiling methods.
Our goal is to provide researchers, both new and established, a place to discover and document awesome Cytodata resources.

## Software

Open source software packages for image-based profiling of biological phenotypes.

- [Advanced Cell Classifier](https://www.cellclassifier.org/) - A software package for exploration, annotation and classification of cells within large datasets using machine learning.
- [CellProfiler](http://cellprofiler.org/) - CellProfiler is a free open-source software for measuring and analyzing cell images.
- [CellProfiler Analyst](http://cellprofiler.org/cp-analyst/) - Interactive data exploration, analysis, and classification of large biological image sets.
- [Cytominer](https://github.com/cytomining/cytominer) - Methods for image-based cell profiling.
- [EBImage](https://github.com/aoles/EBImage) - Image processing toolbox for R.
- [HTSvis](http://htsvis.dkfz.de/HTSvis/) - A web app for exploratory data analysis and visualization of arrayed high-throughput screens.

## Datasets

Annotated datasets for image-based profiling.

- [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://data.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/) - The Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC) is a collection of freely downloadable microscopy image sets. In addition to the images themselves, each set includes a description of the biological application and some type of "ground truth" (expected results).
- [Image Data Resource](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/) - Public repository of image datasets from published scientific studies.
- [RxRx1](https://www.rxrx.ai) - RxRx1 is a set of 125,514 high-resolution 512x512 6-channel fluorescence microscopy images of human cells under 1,108 genetic perturbations in 51 experimental batches across four cell types.  The images were produced by Recursion Pharmaceuticals in their labs in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Researchers will use this dataset for studying and benchmarking methods for dealing with biological batch effects, as well as areas in machine learning such as domain adaptation, transfer learning, and k-shot learning.
