## Software

Open source software packages for image-based profiling of biological phenotypes.

- [Advanced Cell Classifier](https://www.cellclassifier.org/) Advanced Cell Classifier is a data analyzer program to evaluate cell-based high-content screens and tissue section images.
- [CellProfiler](http://cellprofiler.org/) CellProfiler is a free open-source software for measuring and analyzing cell images.
- [CellProfiler Analyst](http://cellprofiler.org/cp-analyst/) Interactive data exploration, analysis, and classification of large biological image sets.
- [Cytominer](https://github.com/cytomining/cytominer) Methods for image-based cell profiling.
- [EBImage](https://github.com/aoles/EBImage) Image processing toolbox for R.
- [HTSvis](http://htsvis.dkfz.de/HTSvis/) A web app for exploratory data analysis and visualization of arrayed high-throughput screens.


## Datasets

Annotated datasets for image-based profiling.

- [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://data.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/) The Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC) is a collection of freely downloadable microscopy image sets. In addition to the images themselves, each set includes a description of the biological application and some type of "ground truth" (expected results).
- [RxRx1](https://www.rxrx.ai) RxRx1 is a set of 125,514 high-resolution 512x512 6-channel fluorescence microscopy images of human cells under 1,108 genetic perturbations in 51 experimental batches across four cell types.  The images were produced by Recursion Pharmaceuticals in their labs in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Researchers will use this dataset for studying and benchmarking methods for dealing with biological batch effects, as well as areas in machine learning such as domain adaptation, transfer learning, and k-shot learning.


## Publications
